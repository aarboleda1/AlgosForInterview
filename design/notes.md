# SQL vs NoSQL
- *SQL*, Store rows and columns. Each row stores all
information regarding one entity and each column
stores each data point

- *NoSQL*, Different types of NoSQL
  - Key-ValueStores: RocksDB,
  - Document Databases: Everstore
  - Graph Databases: TAO

## Main differences:
- SQL Databases are vertically scalable while NoSQL are
horizontally scalable
## Reasons to use NoSQL database
When all the other components of our application are fast and seamless, NoSQL databases prevent data from being the bottleneck. Big data is contributing to a large success for NoSQL databases, mainly because it handles data differently than the traditional relational databases. A few popular examples of NoSQL databases are MongoDB, CouchDB, Cassandra, and HBase.

Storing large volumes of data that often have little to no structure. A NoSQL database sets no limits on the types of data we can store together and allows us to add new types as the need changes. With document-based databases, you can store data in one place without having to define what “types” of data those are in advance.
Making the most of cloud computing and storage. Cloud-based storage is an excellent cost-saving solution but requires data to be easily spread across multiple servers to scale up. Using commodity (affordable, smaller) hardware on-site or in the cloud saves you the hassle of additional software and NoSQL databases like Cassandra are designed to be scaled across multiple data centers out of the box, without a lot of headaches.
Rapid development. NoSQL is extremely useful for rapid development as it doesn’t need to be prepped ahead of time. If you’re working on quick iterations of your system which require making frequent updates to the data structure without a lot of downtime between versions, a relational database will slow you down.
