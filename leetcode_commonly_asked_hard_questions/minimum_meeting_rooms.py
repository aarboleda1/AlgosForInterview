"""
https://leetcode.com/problems/meeting-rooms-ii/
Pretty universal ninja question, including both new grads and experienced
engineers. Usually not as high signal for people with intense algorithms
backgrounds, e.g., coding competitions, but that problem isn't just restricted
to this question.

This question is usually better as a first question in a Ninja as it can
sometimes take more than half the time, but there are also opportunities
to get good signal while not arriving at an optimal solution, and has some
good stopping points along the way.
