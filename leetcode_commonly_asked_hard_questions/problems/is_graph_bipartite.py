"""
Given an undirected graph, return true if and only if it is bipartite.

Recall that a graph is bipartite if we can split it's set of nodes into two
independent subsets A and B such that every edge in the graph has one node
in A and another node in B.

The graph is given in the following form: graph[i] is a list of indexes j
for which the edge between nodes i and j exists.  Each node is an integer
between 0 and graph.length - 1.  There are no self edges or parallel edges:
graph[i] does not contain i, and it doesn't contain any element twice.
